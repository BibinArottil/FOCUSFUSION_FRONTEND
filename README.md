# Getting started

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app




## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


```
  npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.

The app will be running on port 3000. You can access it in your browser by opening http://localhost:3000.

```
npm run build
```
Build the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
